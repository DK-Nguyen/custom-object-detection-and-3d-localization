# Custom object detection and 3D localization
## Overview
A software to automate the process of constructing the synthetic dataset
in COCO format, train state-of-the-art neural networks from the framework 
[Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), and do depth 
estimate for the detected objects.

The whole pipeline could be seen in Figure 1
